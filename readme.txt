# TimbToweR its a personal proyect to apply the learned (HTML + CSS + JS + React + NodeJS + MongoDB) 
# I'am a curious person passionate for tech and audiovisual art
# My personal and professional roadmap goes to the crypto world but i'm open to any proposal if contribute and inspires me.
# Build a castle it's hard work, but the joy of every minute behind the ideas and creative process it's priceless for me.
#
# The core idea it's to make it responsive and have fun in the process, this is my first proyect without courses or anything.
# Originally it was a hobby, but i turned it into something else.
# When it's gonna be ready? time will tell.
# Erase things that not matter and focus on the core idea it's difficult for me at times, but i will make it.
# Refactoring JS it's gonna be a must for sure, but i think it will improve my logic skills...
